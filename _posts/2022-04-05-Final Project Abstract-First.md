## Final Project Abstract

<br/>
### <span style="color: indianred;">Title of Dataset</span>

*Wandering Women: Women’s travels in the Early Modern Literature*

<br/>
### <span style="color: indianred;">Description of Dataset</span>

*Wandering Women* will be a collection of (mainly) bibliographical information of the texts about/related to the topic of women’s travels in the early modern period, before the 1700s. This dataset will contain both imaginary and real texts/records of women’s journeys by male and female authors. This project’s main goal is to familiarize with writings about women’s travels and understand how early modern women attempted to expand their space, roles, and authority by crossing the traditionally allocated sphere for them—the domestic sphere. Therefore, the travel type in this dataset will be limited to voluntary travels such as journeys for adventures, education, and participation in national affairs or events, not involuntary travels for religious or political persecutions or any other coercions. Also, this dataset will accommodate the texts by both male and female authors in order to (if possible) distinguish and understand how women’s travels are described depending on the author’s gender.

For the project, the data will be collected from various sources, from anthologies of (travel) literature to online archives. After several trials to search for texts about women’s travels at online databases such as *Early English Books Online* (*EEBO*) and *English Short Title Catalogue* (*ESTC*) with the keywords including journey and travel, this research method was found to be less effective than it had been expected since the keywords those online databases suggest/create are inadequate to search for the texts about women’s travels exactly. Nonetheless, those online databases will be used as one of the main tools in order to search for the bibliographical information. Furthermore, more refined keywords will be employed to research the aimed texts as the project progresses.

### <span style="color: indianred;">Metadata</span>
The dataset will consist of three primary metadata, author, text information, and travel information, and each metadata will hold sub-metadata.

### <span style="color: indianred;">Questions</span>

*Wandering Women* dataset could help the audience(s) to answer those questions:
- How many texts related to women’s travels were produced in the early modern period?
- Which gender, either male or female, did contribute to or produce women’s travel texts more?
- What percentage/how many manuscripts by female authors (mainly aristocrats) was/were printed and reprinted?
- What kinds of genres/modes of travel were contributed to deal with women’s travels?
-  Which social class was interested in travel writings?

### <span style="color: indianred;"> Existing Related Scholarly Datasets</span>

- [*Women’s Travel Writing, 1780-1840: A Bio-Bibliographical Database (DWTW)*](https://btw.wlv.ac.uk/)

This project provides a collection of records about women’s travel writing published in Britain and Ireland between 1780 and 1840. The conspicuous differences between this project and *Wandering Women* dataset are the period dealt with, text genre, and the main author’s gender. Contrary to the *Wandering Women* dataset that includes fictional adventures and travelogues and personal records such as diaries by male and female authors, *Women’s Travel Writing* project aims to provide more focused scope of genre—travel narratives—and the records about women’s travels by only female authors. With a similar topic but a different time span, this project would offer a guideline that would be conducive to building the *Wandering Women* dataset, such as how to set inclusion/exclusion criteria for the scope of genre and how to develop the initial stage of the *Wandering Women* dataset further.

- [*Medieval Travel Writing*](https://www-medievaltravel-amdigital-co-uk.access.library.miami.edu/)

This project offers an extensive collection of manuscripts related to travel writings from the later medieval period to the sixteenth century. This project accommodates travel writings written in various European vernaculars, Latin, and partially Chinese. Another noticeable difference between this project and the *Wandering Women* dataset is that *Medieval Travel Writing* mainly contains texts authored by male travelers such as Marco Polo and their journeys to the East; and their purposes of travels are relevant to real events and affairs such as pilgrimage, commercial and slave trade, and missionary. This project also could present an effective direction of how to define the genre of travel or travel writing for building the *Wandering Women* dataset.

More information of related or relevant projects or datasets will be posted if they are found.
